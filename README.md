## 🗂️ Categories

## ⚠️ Missing Challenges

Several **web** challenges are intentionally **not included** in this archive because they were entirely server-dependent and cannot be reproduced in a static context. These include:

- SQL Injection
- JWT Cracking
- Mail/SMTP access challenges

Since these required a live backend to interact with, archiving only the problem statement would not provide enough context for meaningful practice.
