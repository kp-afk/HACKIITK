Story: The Forgotten Prototype

The vehicle arrived on a flatbed without markings, plates, or paperwork — just an aging chassis and a sealed onboard network still quietly alive beneath the dust.
Its development history has been lost, and whatever company built it never documented anything publicly.
But one thing is certain: this car did exist, and the world once knew who created it and where it came from.

Your mission is simple in words, but not in execution:
uncover the car’s origin — determine the country it was built in, and the manufacturer who made it.

Inside the glovebox, under brittle wiring and decayed foam, a technician’s old notebook was found.
Most pages are empty, torn, or stained beyond recognition.
But near the back, a few preserved lines remain — fragments of diagnostic attempts, scribbled numbers, mismatched sequences, small pairs of values that seem to correspond to something.
They are not labeled, and they explain nothing.
But patterns lurk in them, waiting to be recognized by someone who knows how to listen.

The onboard network itself is cautious.
It does not immediately reveal its structure or speak freely.
It expects the right approach, the right state, the right sequence of actions before sharing anything meaningful.
Modules remain quiet until they trust the one asking.

Somewhere inside that hidden network lies a single identifier that carries the machine’s past — the key to learning who built it and where it was made.
Nothing tells you where that information is stored.
Nothing tells you how to reach it.
Only an aging access point and a cryptic logbook remain to guide you.

Follow the signals.
Interpret the patterns.
And let the network tell its story… once it believes you deserve to hear it.
